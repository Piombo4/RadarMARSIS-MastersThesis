<h1 align="center">Analysis and mitigation of interferences in MARSIS radargrams:<br/>A computer vision-based approach</h1>
This project is my Master's thesis in Computer Engineering, carried out following my internship at the Institute of Radio Astronomy in Bologna.

## About The Project
MARSIS is a radar mounted on board the Mars Ex-press spacecraft. Its primary goal is to map the dis-tribution of water, both in liquid and solid form, in the Martian subsurface.
The data were acquired by transmitting radio pulses centered at 1.8, 3, 4, or 5 MHz, each with a band-width of 1 MHz. The raw data produced by the radar, corresponding to a single orbit, consist of a matrix of echoes, in which the columns represent the individual echoes.
If necessary, a reduced amount of data can be saved in a flash memory and sent to Earth still in raw form, where they undergo a processing opera-tion.
Nevertheless, the data, both raw and processed, re-main strongly affected by various noise sources, including interference generated by onboard elec-tronics, local plasma resonances, attenuation and dispersion introduced by the ionosphere, and echoes originating from distant regions of the surface.
It has been hypothesized that, once the echo matrix is projected into the Fourier frequency space through a two-dimensional transform, the effects described above become more easily recognizable and sepa-rable. The result is a representation that we will call the “Doppler–frequency diagram.”
After examining a large amount of samples, three main types of interference were classified, each with its own characteristic appearance, while it was ob-served that the useful part of the signal is concen-trated in a very narrow vertical band which, in the raw data, aligns along the Doppler frequency caused by the spacecraft’s vertical motion.
It is hypothesized that it may be possible to use computer vision techniques to automatically identi-fy the interference in order to create a systematic catalog, facilitating statistical analysis.
The algorithms were developed in Python using the OpenCV library.
The YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm was tested for the identification of the last type.
The second part of the work focused on filtering the processed data using statistical criteria based on the median values of the columns of the Doppler–frequency diagram.

## Interferences detection
For the first two types of interference, algorithms were developed that automatically detect interferences in the images using OpenCV. For the last type, YOLO was used.

## Data filtering
The second part of my Thesis is focused on data filtering. The algorithm, this time developed in MATLAB, is based on calculating the median of each column, obtaining a one-dimensional representation of the spectrogram with peaks corresponding to the portion of the useful part of the signal, as it is usually the brightest part of the image.
Then, to decide a threshold below which the median values are set to zero, Otsu’s binarization method was used, which automatically calculates the threshold by minimizing intra-class variance, assum-ing the image contains only two classes.
Once the filtering is performed, it is sufficient to cal-culate the inverse transform and compare the signal-to-noise ratio before and after the cleaning operation. On 25 filtered orbits, an average increase of ~16 dB was observed.
